# React Router Dom v6 Catch-all Route Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router DOM v6.  The problem occurs when the catch-all route doesn't correctly handle requests for paths not explicitly defined.  This results in unexpected behavior, such as the application rendering nothing or showing a blank screen instead of the intended 404 page.

The solution provided addresses this issue by demonstrating a correct implementation of the catch-all route, ensuring that any undefined routes are handled appropriately.
